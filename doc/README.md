# Project 1: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the main.Rmd for training the 4 models on the chosen features. The directory also contains training Convolutional Neural Network in Python. Finally, the separate sift.Rmd shows the steps we've taken to extract the SIFT feature.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The three markdowns pull from feature.R, train.R, and test.R in the lib directory that each includes the features used (rgb, hsv, hog, and sift), models for training (randomForest, gbm, logistic regression, and SVM), and test.R that includes the baseline gbm model, respectively. 

Finally, a PDF form of the presentation outlining our process and results is also in the doc directory.
